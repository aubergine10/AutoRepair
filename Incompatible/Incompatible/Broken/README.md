# Broken Mods

The main purpose of this class is to define a list of known broken or obsolete, collectively "broken", mods.

To make the list, a mod must meet one or more of the following criteria:

* Marked by community moderators/admins as "Incompatible" in the workshop
* Marked as "Deprecated", "Obsolete" or "Broken" by the mod author
* Comments section filled with bug reports yet no signs of updates from the author
* No longer available in the workshop (deleted by author or admins)
* Known to cause severe problems with the game or other mods

On that last point, if it's merely an issue with mod conflicts we can deal with that separately and thus not need to classify such mods as "broken".

It should also be noted that many users somehow manage to retain subscriptions to broken mods and, on occasion, even mods that have been removed from the workshop. I have no idea how this is possible, but as of 2019 it's still happening (albeit rarely).

Where possible, we will try and replace broken mods with suitable alternatives. However, if no alterntives can be found, broken mods will be unsubscribed.
