# Broken Mods

The main purpose of this class is to define a list of known broken or obsolete, collectively "broken", mods.

To make the list, a mod must meet one or more of the following criteria:

* Marked as incompatible in the workshop
* No longer available in the workshop
* Marked as "Deprecated", "Obsolete" or "Broken" by the mod author
* Comments section filled with bug reports yet no signs of updates from the author
* Known to cause severe problems with the game or other mods

On that last point, if it's merely an issue with mod conflicts we can deal with that separately and thus not need to classify such mods as "broken".

Where possible, we will try and replace broken mods with suitable alternatives. However, if no alterntives can be found, broken mods will be unsubscribed.
