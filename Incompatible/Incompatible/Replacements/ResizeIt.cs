     * Why 'Resize It!' instead of 'More Advanced Toolbar'?
     * 
     * From end-user perspective, Resize It is easier to work with and has fewer
     * incompatibilities with other mods (particularly Find It and Ploppable RICO).
     * 
     * The replacement definition below will only prompt users to upgrade to Resize It
     * if they are using an old broken toolbar mod (denoted by '*' in deprecation list).
     * 
     * However, if users enable 'Show all upgrade recommendations' they will be asked
     * to upgrade from 'More Advanced Toolbar' to 'Resize It'.
     * 
     * If 'More Advanced Toolbar' is updated to be more compatible with other mods,
     * we will revise this repllacement script to offer a choice between the two mods.
